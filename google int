Write a funtion that takes two strings, s1 and s2 and return th elongest common susequence of s1 and s2

'ABAZDC', 'BACBAD' => 'ABAD'
'AGGTAB', 'GXTXAYB" => 'GTAB'
'aaaa', 'aa' => 'aa'

// start a pointer at s1[0] and a pointer at s2[0]
// if s1[0] === s2[0], move both up
// else if s1[0] !== s2[0] move s2 pointer up one 

function subString(s1, s2) {
    let s1Pointer = 0;
    let s2Pointer = 0;

    let longest = s1.length > s2.length ? s1.length : s2.length;
    let finalStr = '';

    while (s1Pointer < longest) {
        if (s1[s1Pointer] === s2[s2Pointer]) {
            s1Pointer++;
            s2Pointer++;
            finalStr += s1[s1Pointer]
        }
        s2Pointer++;
    }
    return finalStr;
}

subString('ABAZDC', 'BACBAD');

'ABAZDC', 'BACBAD'
 ^         ^ // condition not met, increase s2Pointer

'ABAZDC', 'BACBAD'
 ^          ^ // condition met, increase both pointers and push A to finalStr;

'ABAZDC', 'BACBAD'
  ^          ^ // Condition not met, increase s2Pointer

'ABAZDC', 'BACBAD'
  ^           ^ // Condition met, increase both pointers and push B to finalStr;

'ABAZDC', 'BACBAD'
   ^           ^ //   Condition met, increase both pointers and push A to finalStr;

'ABAZDC', 'BACBAD'
    ^           ^ // Condtion not met, increase s2Pointer

// if s1[i] === s2[j] move both pointers up and pass in the value of the str
// else move s2 pointer up
// if s1 pointer == s1.length move s2 pointer up until you find a match and pass it in
// if s2 pointer === s2.length move s1 pointer up until you find a match and pass it in
// return str
